# On the Anomaly Detection in Time Series Data with Kernel PCA Algorithm

This is the reproduction of the Kernel PCA anomaly detection experiment, originally conducted by Hoffman, on a select time series datasets. 

Each dataset is numbered from 1-3 to enable the user-selection. So, if you want to run the experiment on your machine on a third dataset, open the Terminal and type ```python3 main.py 3 ``` in the window.
